This takes a series of images in res/BadApple and recreates the frames in the given range. For each image, thousands of edge-to-edge lines are drawn on a white canvas to imitate the image.

To decide each line, one the darkest points of the image are chosen, and a bunch of random lines are tested through that point to find one that will best represent the image.

While this can recreate any image, I just made this to [recreate Bad Apple](https://youtu.be/Y-gFajE5UEM):
